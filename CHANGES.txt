Tablicious Changelog
====================

Version 0.4.0 (in progress)
-----------------------------

* Require Octave 7.x or later.
* Fix Octave 7.x and 8.x compatibility in installation and package loading.
* Fix `string.missing()` and to actually return a missing value, instead of "".
* Remove `(fill,rm,standardize)missing` functions, deferring to the Statistics package.
* `table` arrays:
  * `table`: Fix "preallocation" constructor to use 0s and ""s for fill values, unless missings are requested using an alternate pseudotype. (For compatibility with Matlab.)
  * `table`: Have `fieldnames (obj)` expose variable and dimension names and Properties, instead of the internal implementation properties.
  * `table`: Fix some advanced ()- and {}-indexing cases, including some related to multi-variable subscripting, multi-column table variables, multi-column RHS inputs, and the combination of the three.
  * `table`: Remove `grpstats` method and replace with `tblish.table.grpstats()` function, to avoid overriding or interacting with Statistics' `grpstats()` function.
  * `table`: Remove `rows`, `cols`, `reshape`, `resize`, `vec`, `hasrownames`, and `size_equal` methods.
  * `table`: Make `congruentize` aprivate function.
  * Add `istable`, `istimetable`, and `istabular` functions.
* Fix `x(ix) = []` element deletion for string, datetime, table, and other classes.
* Add idempotent one-arg constructor forms for string, datetime, categorical. (But not table.)
* Add `NaS`, `NaC`, and `todatetime` functions.
* Rename `+tablicious` package to `+tblish`; merge `+octave` package into `+tblish`.
* Move `+table_examples` package to `+tblish/+examples`.
* Move the `sizeof()` override methods to a `tblish.sizeof()` function to avoid shadowing core Octave's `sizeof`, until I understand if it's intended to support extension by classdefs.
* Make internal-use properties on the main classes Access = private, now that the code is a little more mature.
* Fix the doco generation, including publishing to GitHub Pages.

Internal:

* Convert code style to GNU Octave code style, mostly.
* Move `mustBe*` functions to a `validators/` subdirectory, just for tidiness.
* Revamp doc-generation tools.
* Add experimental MP-Test based unit tests to supplement BISTs, for detailed testing of `table` behavior.

Version 0.3.7 (2023-01-05)
-----------------------------

* Fix installation under Octave 7.x. (#91)
* Fix orphaned sections in documentation.
* Add table.size_equal method. (#81)
* Add string.empty static method.

Internal refactoring:

* Rearrange doco files so the main source file is named `*.texi` and its extension is recognized by editors.

Version 0.3.6 (2021-07-05)
-----------------------------

* Fix multi-argout calling form of table.size. (Thanks, @rdzman!)
* Fix table dot-indexing assignment by having table.numel always return 1.
* Support arbitrary strings as variable names (#82).

Version 0.3.5 (2020-01-30)
-----------------------------

* Fix compiler warnings on systems with 32-bit `octave_idx_type`

Version 0.3.4 (2020-01-28)
-----------------------------

* Octave 6.x compatibility: move some mustBe* validators into compatibility shims

Version 0.3.3 (2020-01-28)
-----------------------------

* Fix version metadata in the distribution

Version 0.3.2 (2020-01-28)
-----------------------------

* sprintf and fprintf support for datetime, categorical, and other classes
* Added this ChangeLog
* Octave 6.x compatibility fix: use different function for registering QHelp doco

Version 0.3.1 (2020-01-27)
-----------------------------

* Fix a dumb bug that broke string
* Fix "shadowed function" warning in Octave 5.x

Version 0.3.0 (2020-01-18)
-----------------------------

* Various bugfixes
* Added some examples

This is the release that I think is ready for general consumption by the user community.

Version 0.2.0 (2019-05-05)
-----------------------------

* More basic table stuff
* Now with datetime and duration, since Iâ€™ve merged the Chrono package into this project

* @string and @categorical
* The start of some example data sets
* Bug fixes, of course

Version 0.1.0 (2019-04-30)
-----------------------------

Initial release!

This library is about 2/3 feature complete. Most basic table, string, categorical, and
Missing Data stuff is working, and there's documentation.
