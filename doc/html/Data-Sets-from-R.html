<p>Many of Tablicious’ example data sets are based on the example datasets
found in R’s <code class="code">datasets</code> package. R can be found at
<a class="url" href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</a>, and documentation for its <code class="code">datasets</code>
is at <a class="url" href="https://rdrr.io/r/datasets/datasets-package.html">https://rdrr.io/r/datasets/datasets-package.html</a>.
Thanks to the R developers for producing the original data sets here.
</p>
<p>Tablicious’ examples’ code tries to replicate the R examples, so it can
be useful to compare the two of them if you are moving from one language to
another.
</p>
<p>Core Octave currently lacks some of the plotting features found in the R
examples, such as LOWESS smoothing and linear model characteristic plots, so
you will just find “TODO” placeholders for these in Tablicious’ example code.
