## Split data into groups and apply function.
##
## @var{func} is a function handle to call on each group of inputs in turn.
##
## @var{X}, @var{X1}, @dots{}, @var{XN} are the input variables that are split into
## groups for the function calls. If @var{X} is a @code{table}, then its contained
## variables are “popped out” and considered to be the @var{X1} @dots{} @var{XN}
## input variables.
##
## @var{G} is the grouping variable vector. It contains a list of integers that
## identify which group each element of the @var{X} input variables belongs to.
## NaNs in @var{G} mean that element is ignored.
##
## Vertically concatenates the function outputs for each of the groups and returns them in
## as many variables as you capture.
##
## Returns the concatenated outputs of applying @var{func} to each group.
##
## See also: @ref{table.groupby}, @ref{table.splitapply}
