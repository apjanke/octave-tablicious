## @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{x} =} mustBeVector (@var{x}, @var{label})
##
## Requires that input is a vector or empty.
##
## Raises an error if the input @var{x} is not a row vector and is not 0-by-0 empty.
##
## @var{label} is an optional input that determines how the input will be described in
## error messages. If not supplied, @code{inputname (1)} is used, and if that is
## empty, it falls back to "input".
