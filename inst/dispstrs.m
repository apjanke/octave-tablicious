## @deftypefn {Function} {@var{out} =} dispstrs (@var{x})
##
## Display strings for array.
##
## Gets the display strings for each element of @var{x}. The display strings
## should be short, one-line, human-presentable strings describing the
## value of that element.
##
## The default implementation of @code{dispstrs} can accept input of any
## type, and has decent implementations for Octaveâ€™s standard built-in types,
## but will have opaque displays for most user-defined objects.
##
## This is a polymorphic method that user-defined classes may override
## with their own custom display that is more informative.
##
## Returns a cell array the same size as @var{x}.
##
