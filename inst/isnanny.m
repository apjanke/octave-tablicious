## @deftypefn {Function} {@var{out} =} isnanny (@var{X})
##
## Test if elements are NaN or NaN-like
##
## Tests if input elements are NaN, NaT, or otherwise NaN-like. This is true
## if @code{isnan()} or @code{isnat()} returns true, and is false for types that do not support
## @code{isnan()} or @code{isnat()}.
##
## This function only exists because:
##
## @enumerate a
## @item
## Matlab decided to call their NaN values for datetime “NaT” instead, and
## test for them with a different “isnat()” function, and
## @item
## isnan() errors out for some types that do not support isnan(), like cells.
## @end enumerate
##
## @code{isnanny()} smooths over those differences so you can call it polymorphically on
## any input type.
##
## Under normal operation, @code{isnanny()} should not throw an error for any type or
## value of input.
##
## See also: ismissing, @code{isnan}, @code{isnat}, @ref{eqn}, @code{isequaln}
