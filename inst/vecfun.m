## @deftypefn {Function} {@var{out} =} vecfun (@var{fcn}, @var{x}, @var{dim})
##
## Apply function to vectors in array along arbitrary dimension.
##
## This function is not implemented yet.
##
## Applies a given function to the vector slices of an N-dimensional array, where
## those slices are along a given dimension.
##
## @var{fcn} is a function handle to apply.
##
## @var{x} is an array of arbitrary type which is to be sliced and passed
## in to @var{fcn}.
##
## @var{dim} is the dimension along which the vector slices lay.
##
## Returns the collected output of the @var{fcn} calls, which will be
## the same size as @var{x}, but not necessarily the same type.
##
## @end deftypefn
