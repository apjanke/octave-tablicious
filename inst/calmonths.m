## @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{out} =} calmonths (@var{x})
## Create a @code{calendarDuration} that is a given number of calendar months
## long.
##
## Input @var{x} is a numeric array specifying the number of calendar months.
##
## This is a shorthand alternative to calling the @code{calendarDuration} 
## constructor with @code{calendarDuration(0, x, 0)}.
##
## Returns a new @code{calendarDuration} object of the same size as @var{x}.
##
## @xref{calendarDuration}.
##
## @end deftypefn

function out = calmonths (x)
  %CALMONTHS Calendar duration in months
  if ~isnumeric (x)
    error ('Input must be numeric');
