## @deftypefn {Function} {@var{out} =} vartype (@var{type})
##
## Filter by variable type for use in suscripting.
##
## Creates an object that can be used for subscripting into the variables
## dimension of a table and filtering on variable type.
##
## @var{type} is the name of a type as charvec. This may be anything that
## the @code{isa} function accepts, or @code{'cellstr'} to select cellstrs,
## as determined by @code{iscellstr}.
##
## Returns an object of an opaque type. Donâ€™t worry about what type it is;
## just pass it into the second argument of a subscript into a @code{table}
## object.

function out = vartype (type)
  mustBeCharvec (type);
  out = tblish.internal.table.vartype_filter (type);
