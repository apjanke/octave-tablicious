## @deftypefn {Function} {@var{out} =} eqn (@var{A}, @var{B})
##
## Determine element-wise equality, treating NaNs as equal
##
## out = eqn (A, B)
##
## @code{eqn} is just like @code{eq} (the function that implements the 
## @code{==} operator), except
## that it considers NaN and NaN-like values to be equal. This is the element-wise
## equivalent of @code{isequaln}.
##
## @code{eqn} uses @code{isnanny} to test for NaN and NaN-like values, 
## which means that NaNs and NaTs are considered to be NaN-like, and 
## string arrays’ “missing” and categorical objects’ “undefined” values 
## are considered equal, because they are NaN-ish.
##
## Developer's note: the name “@code{eqn}” is a little unfortunate,
## because “eqn” could also be an abbreviation for “equation”. But this 
## name follows the @code{isequaln} pattern of appending an “n” to the
## corresponding non-NaN-equivocating function.
##
## See also: @code{eq}, @code{isequaln}, @ref{isnanny}
