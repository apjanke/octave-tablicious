## @node tblish.sizeof
## @deftypefn {Function} {@var{out} =} sizeof (@var{x})
##
## Approximate size of an array in bytes.
##
## For tables, this returns the sume of @code{sizeof} for all of its variablesâ€™
## arrays, plus the size of the VariableNames and any other metadata stored in @var{obj}.
##
## This is currently broken for some types, because its implementation is in transition
## from overridden methods on Tablicious's objects to a separate function.
##
## This is not supported, fully or at all, for all input types, but it has support
## for the types defined in Tablicious, plus some Octave built-in types, and makes a
## best effort at figuring out user-defined classdef objects. It currently does not
## have extensibility support for customization by classdef classes, but that may be
## added in the future, in which case its output may change significantly for classdef
## objects in future releases.
##
## @var{x} is an array of any type.
##
## Returns a scalar numeric. Returns NaN for types that are known to not be supported,
## instead of raising an error. Raises an error if it fails to determine the size of an
## input of a type that it thought was supported.
