function [ixs, ixUnmatchedA, ixUnmatchedB] = matchrows (A, B)
  %MATCHROWS Find all matching (equal) row value pairs in input matrixes
  %
  % [ixs, ixUnmatchedA, ixUnmatchedB] = matchrows (A, B)
  %
  % This function is for the internal use of table. It is intended that this will
  % be made private or +internal before release 1.0 time; it is currently public 
  % to support convenient debugging.
  %
  % Returns:
  % ixs - an n-by-2 double matrix where each row contains (iA, iB) which are the
  %       the indexes of rows from A and B which had equal values.
  % ixUnmatchedA - a vector of indexes of rows from A which had no matches in B
  % ixUnmatchedB - a vector of indexes of rows from B which had no matches in A
  %
  % This is an Octave extension.
  %
  % Developer notes: It is my intent that if this function turns out to be useful,
  % the slow generic dumb-nested-loops implementation could be supplemented by
  % optimized implementations of smarter matching algorithms for numerics.
  % In particular:
  %  a) an oct-file using a modified merge sort could be implemented to get this down
  %     to O(n log n) time, with a per-operation cost of C-based numeric row
  %     comparisons with short-circuiting.
  %  b) for numerics, a "unique trick" similar to that used to generate proxy 
  %     keys could be used to get this down to scalar numeric proxies for row
  %     values (as long as output ordering for partial-NaN rows is not significant),
  %     at which point a pair of ismember() calls might work.
