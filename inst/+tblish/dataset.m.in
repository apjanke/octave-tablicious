## The @code{tblish.dataset} class provides convenient access to the various
## datasets included with Tablicious.
##
## This class just contains a bunch of static methods, each of which loads
## the dataset of that name. It is provided as a convenience so you can use tab
## completion or other run-time introspection on the dataset list.
