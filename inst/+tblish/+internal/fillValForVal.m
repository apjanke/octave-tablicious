## @deftypefn {Function} {@var{out} =} fillValForVal (@var{x})
##
## Outer fill value for variable within a table.
##
## Determines the fill value to usse for a given variable value @var{x}
## when that value is used as a variable in a table that is involved in
## an outer join.
##
## The default implementation for @code{fillValForVal} has support for
## all Octave primitive types, plus cellstrs, datetime & friends, strings,
## and @code{table}-valued variables.
##
## This function may become private to table before version 1.0. It is currently
## global to make debugging more convenient. It (or an equivalent) will remain
## global if we want to allow user-defined classes to customize their fill value.
## It also has default logic that will determine the fill value for an arbitrary
## type by detecting the value used to fill elements during array expansion
## operations. This will be appropriate for most data types.
## 
## Returns a 1-by-ncols value of the same type as x, which may be any type, where
## ncols is the number of columns in the input.
