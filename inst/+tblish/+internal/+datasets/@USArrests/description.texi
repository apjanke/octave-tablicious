@subsubheading Note

@code{USArrests} contains the data as in McNeil's monograph. For the
@code{UrbanPop} percentages, a review of the table (No. 21) in the
Statistical Abstracts 1975 reveals a transcription error for Maryland
(and that McNeil used the same “round to even” rule), as found by
Daniel S Coven (Arizona).

See the example below on how to correct the error and improve accuracy
for the ‘<n>.5’ percentages.
