@subsubheading Description

400 triples of successive random numbers were taken from the VAX FORTRAN
function RANDU running under VMS 1.5.

@subsubheading Format

@table @code
@item record
Index of the record.
@item x
X value of the triple.
@item y
Y value of the triple.
@item z
Z value of the triple.
@end table

@subsubheading Details

In three dimensional displays it is evident that the triples fall on 15
parallel planes in 3-space. This can be shown theoretically to be true
for all triples from the RANDU generator.

These particular 400 triples start 5 apart in the sequence, that is they
are ((U[5i+1], U[5i+2], U[5i+3]), i= 0, ..., 399), and they are rounded
to 6 decimal places.

Under VMS versions 2.0 and higher, this problem has been fixed.
