@subsubheading Details

Under the life-cycle savings hypothesis as developed by Franco Modigliani, the
savings ratio (aggregate personal saving divided by disposable income) is
explained by per-capita disposable income, the percentage rate of change in
per-capita disposable income, and two demographic variables: the percentage
of population less than 15 years old and the percentage of the population over
75 years old. The data are averaged over the decade 1960–1970 to remove the
business cycle or other short-term fluctuations.
