@subsubheading Description

A classical data of Michelson (but not this one with Morley) on measurements
done in 1879 on the speed of light. The data consists of five experiments,
each consisting of 20 consecutive ‘runs’. The response is the speed of
light measurement, suitably coded (km/sec, with 299000 subtracted).

@subsubheading Format

@table @code
@item Expt
The experiment number, from 1 to 5.
@item Run
The run number within each experiment.
@item Speed
Speed-of-light measurement.

@subsubheading Details

The data is here viewed as a randomized block experiment with @code{experiment}
and @code{run} as the factors. @code{run} may also be considered a quantitative
variate to account for linear (or polynomial) changes in the measurement over
the course of a single experiment.
