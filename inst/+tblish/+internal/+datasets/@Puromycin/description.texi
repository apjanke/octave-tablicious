Reaction velocity versus substrate concentration in an enzymatic reaction
involving untreated cells or cells treated with Puromycin.

@subsubheading Format

@table @code
@item state
Whether the cell was treated.
@item conc
Substrate concentrations (ppm).
@item rate
Instantaneous reaction rates (counts/min/min).

@subsubheading Details

Data on the velocity of an enzymatic reaction were obtained by Treloar
(1974). The number of counts per minute of radioactive product from the
reaction was measured as a function of substrate concentration in parts per
million (ppm) and from these counts the initial rate (or velocity) of the
reaction was calculated (counts/min/min). The experiment was conducted once
with the enzyme treated with Puromycin, and once with the enzyme untreated.
