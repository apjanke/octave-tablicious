@subsubheading Details

Individual cells of dry comb were filled with measured amounts of lime
sulphur emulsion in sucrose solution. Seven different concentrations of lime
sulphur ranging from a concentration of 1/100 to 1/1,562,500 in successive
factors of 1/5 were used as well as a solution containing no lime sulphur.

The responses for the different solutions were obtained by releasing 100
bees into the chamber for two hours, and then measuring the decrease in volume
of the solutions in the various cells.

An 8 x 8 Latin square design was used and the treatments were coded as follows:

A – highest level of lime sulphur
B – next highest level of lime sulphur
@dots{}
G – lowest level of lime sulphur
H – no lime sulphur
