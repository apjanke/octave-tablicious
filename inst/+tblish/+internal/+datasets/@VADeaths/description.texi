@subsubheading Description

Death rates per 1000 in Virginia in 1940.

@subsubheading Format

A 2-dimensional matrix @code{deaths}, with age group along dimension 1 and
demographic group along dimension 2.

@subsubheading Details

The death rates are measured per 1000 population per year. They are
cross-classified by age group (rows) and population group (columns). The
age groups are: 50–54, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, 70–74 and the population groups
are Rural/Male, Rural/Female, Urban/Male and Urban/Female.

This provides a rather nice 3-way analysis of variance example.
