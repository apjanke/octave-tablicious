classdef (Abstract) dataset
  #DATASET An example dataset, managed by Tablicious’ datasets mechanism
  #
  # To use this, subclass it, and have your constructor populate
  # the name and description fields, and implement load(), regenerate(),
  # and possibly fetch().
  #
  # There are three typical ways to define a dataset:
  #   - All in code, in which case your subclass will just implement load()
  #   - As a stored, checked-in mat-file, in which case your subclass will
  #       implement regenerate_dataset() and load()
  #   - As a cached post-installation mat-file, in which case your subclass
  #       will implement cache_dataset() and load(), and make use of
  #       cache_file_path() in both of them.
