## @deftypefn {Function} {@var{out} =} tblish.sizeof2 (@var{x})
##
## Approximate size of an array in bytes, with object support.
##
## This is an alternative to Octave's @code{sizeof} function that tries to provide
## meaningful support for objects, including the classes defined in Tablicious. It is
## named "sizeof2" instead of "sizeof" to avoid a "shadowing core function" warning
## when loading Tablicious, because it seems that Octave does not consider packages
## (namespaces) when detecting shadowed functions.
##
## This may be supplemented or replaced by @code{sizeof} override methods on Tablicious's
## classes. I'm not sure whether Octave's @code{sizeof} supports extension by method
## overrides, so I'm not doing that yet. If that happens, this @code{sizeof2} function
## will stick around in a deprecated state for a while, and it will respect those override
## methods.
##
## For tables, this returns the sum of @code{sizeof} for all of its variablesâ€™
## arrays, plus the size of the VariableNames and any other metadata stored in @var{obj}.
##
## This is currently broken for some types, because its implementation is in transition
## from overridden methods on Tablicious's objects to a separate function.
##
## This is not supported, fully or at all, for all input types, but it has support
## for the types defined in Tablicious, plus some Octave built-in types, and makes a
## best effort at figuring out user-defined classdef objects. It currently does not
## have extensibility support for customization by classdef classes, but that may be
## added in the future, in which case its output may change significantly for classdef
## objects in future releases.
##
## @var{x} is an array of any type.
##
## Returns a scalar numeric. Returns NaN for types that are known to not be supported,
## instead of raising an error. Raises an error if it fails to determine the size of an
## input of a type that it thought was supported.
