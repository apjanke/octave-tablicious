## @deftypefn {Function} {@var{out} =} timezones ()
## @deftypefnx {Function} {@var{out} =} timezones (@var{area})
##
## List all the time zones defined on this system.
##
## This lists all the time zones that are defined in the IANA time zone database
## used by this Octave. (On Linux and macOS, that will generally be the system
## time zone database from @file{/usr/share/zoneinfo}. On Windows, it will be
## the database redistributed with the Tablicious package.
##
## If the return is captured, the output is returned as a table if your Octave
## has table support, or a struct if it does not. It will have fields/variables
## containing column vectors:
##
## @table @code
## @item Name
## The IANA zone name, as cellstr.
## @item Area
## The geographical area the zone is in, as cellstr.
## @end table
##
## Compatibility note: Matlab also includes UTCOffset and DSTOffset fields in
## the output; these are currently unimplemented.
