## @deftypefn {Function} {@var{out} =} NaS ()
## @deftypefnx {Function} {@var{out} =} NaS (@var{sz})
##
## â€œNot-a-String". Creates missing-valued string arrays.
##
## Returns a new @code{string} array of all missing values of
## the given size. If no input @var{sz} is given, the result is a scalar missing
## string.
##
## @code{NaS} is the @code{string} equivalent of @code{NaN} or @code{NaT}. It
## represents a missing, invalid, or null value. @code{NaS} values never compare
## equal to any value, including other @code{NaS}s.
##
## @code{NaS} is a convenience function which is strictly a wrapper around
## @code{string.missing} and returns the same results, but may be more convenient
## to type and/or more readable, especially in array expressions with several values.
##
