# This example shows how to work with the tables in C. J. Date's classic
# Suppliers-Parts Database example

# The Suppliers-Parts database is defined over in +tblish/+examples

[s,p,sp] = tblish.examples.SpDb;

# Display one of the tables

fprintf('\nTable s:\n');
prettyprint (s)

# Get the suppliers just in London

london_suppliers = s(strcmp (s.City, 'London'),:)
fprintf('\nSuppliers in London:\n')
prettyprint (london_suppliers)

# Suppliers in Paris with a status of 20 or greater

paris = s(strcmp (s.City, 'Paris') & s.Status >= 20,:)
fprintf('\nParis suppliers with status >= 20:\n')
prettyprint (paris)

# Join the tables up so we can do aggregate queries

# Rename the city columns in the Suppliers and Parts table, because we don't
# want to use them as a key
s2 = renamevars (s, {'City' 'SupplierCity'})
p2 = renamevars (p, {'City' 'PartCity'});
# Join all the tables
j = innerjoin(innerjoin(sp, s2), p2);
fprintf('\nJoined tables:\n')
prettyprint (j)

# Calculate the total weight of deliveries
j = setvar (j, 'TotalWeight', j.Qty .* j.Weight);

# Calculate the total parts count and weight for each part city
g = groupby (j, {'PartCity'}, {
  'TotalQty', @sum, 'Qty'
  'TotalWeight', @sum, 'TotalWeight'
  });
fprintf ('\nDelivery totals by city:\n');
prettyprint (g);

# You can also use a trick with strjoin() to compactly display all the values
# for a column in a groupby. Note that you have to use {...} to throw the
# resulting strings into a cell so the output of the function is scalar.
g = groupby (j, {'PartCity'}, {
