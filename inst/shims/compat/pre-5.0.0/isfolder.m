## @deftypefn {Function} {@var{out} =} isfolder (@var{file})
##
## Test whether file exists and is a folder.
##
## Tests whether the given file path @var{file} exists on the filesystem, and
## is a folder (aka “directory”).
##
## @var{file} is a charvec containing the path to the file to test. It may be
## an absolute or relative path.
##
## This is a new, more specific replacement for @code{exist(file, "dir")}. Unlike
## @code{exist}, @code{isfolder} will not search the Octave load path for files.
##
## The underlying logic defers to @code{stat(file)} for determining file existence
## and attributes, so any paths supported by @code{stat} are also supported by
## @code{isfolder}. In particular, it seems that the @code{~} alias for the home
## directory is supported, at least on Unix platforms.
##
## See also: @ref{isfile}, @code{exist}
