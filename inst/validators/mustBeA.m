## Raises an error if the input @var{x} is not of type @var{type}, as determined by
## @code{isa (x, type)}.
##
## @var{label} is an optional input that determines how the input will be described in
## error messages. If not supplied, @code{inputname (1)} is used, and if that is
## empty, it falls back to "input".
