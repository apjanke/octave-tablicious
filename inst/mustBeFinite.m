## @deftypefn {Function File} {@code{x} =} mustBeFinite (@code{x}, @code{label})
##
## Requires that input is finite.
##
## Raises an error if the input @code{x} is not finite, as determined by
## @code{isfinite (x)}.
##
## @code{label} is an optional input that determines how the input will be described in
## error messages. If not supplied, @code{inputname (1)} is used, and if that is
## empty, it falls back to "input".
