## @deftypefn {Function} {@var{out} =} NaT ()
## @deftypefnx {Function} {@var{out} =} NaT (@var{sz})
##
## “Not-a-Time”. Creates missing-valued datetime arrays.
## 
## Constructs a new @code{datetime} array of all @code{NaT} values of
## the given size. If no input @var{sz} is given, the result is a scalar @code{NaT}.
##
## @code{NaT} is the @code{datetime} equivalent of @code{NaN}. It represents a missing
## or invalid value. @code{NaT} values never compare equal to, greater than, or less
## than any value, including other @code{NaT}s. Doing arithmetic with a @code{NaT} and
## any other value results in a @code{NaT}.
##
## @code{NaT} currently cannot create NaT arrays of type @code{localdate}. To do that,
## use @ref{localdate.NaT} instead.
##
## @end deftypefn
function out = NaT (sz)
  %NaT Not-a-Time
  %
  % Creates an array of datetimes with the value NaT.
  if nargin == 0
    out = datetime.NaT;
  else
    out = repmat (datetime.NaT, sz);
  end
