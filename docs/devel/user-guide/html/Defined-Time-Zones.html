<p>Tablicious&rsquo;s time zone data is drawn from the <a class="uref" href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones">IANA Time Zone Database</a>, also known as the “Olson Database”. Tablicious includes a
copy of this database in its distribution so it can work on Windows, which does
not supply it like Unix systems do.
</p>
<p>You can use the <code class="code">timezones</code> function to list the time zones known to Tablicious. These will be
all the time zones in the IANA database on your system (for Linux and macOS) or in the IANA
time zone database redistributed with Tablicious (for Windows).
</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
<p><b class="b">Note:</b> The IANA Time Zone Database only covers dates from about the year 1880 to 2038. Converting
time zones for <code class="code">datetime</code>s outside that range is currently unimplemented. (Tablicious
needs to add support for proleptic POSIX time zone rules, which are used to govern
behavior outside that date range.)
